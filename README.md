# Ansible Side Quest

Welcome to my Ansible Learning Journey repository! This project documents my exploration and hands-on practice with Ansible, a popular open-source IT automation tool. Here, I’ll store my playbooks, roles, inventories, and scripts that demonstrate my progress and understanding of Ansible’s core concepts.

## Overview

#### Why Ansible?

Ansible is an agentless automation tool that uses SSH to manage systems, simplifying the process of provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.


#### Goals:

1) Learn Ansible fundamentals, including inventories, playbooks, and roles.
2) Experiment with Ansible in different environments (local VMs, cloud, Docker containers).
3) Demonstrate use cases through real-world examples and best practices.
